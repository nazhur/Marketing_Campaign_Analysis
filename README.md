# Marketing_Campaign_Analysis
---

## Objective

As a marketing agency, our primary objective is to maximize the return on investment (ROI) for our clients' advertising campaigns. This README outlines my approach to determining the most effective advertising platform between Facebook and AdWords.

## Overview
I conducted two ad campaigns, one on Facebook and the other on AdWords, and I aim to evaluate which platform yields better results in terms of clicks, conversions, and overall cost-effectiveness. By identifying the most effective platform, I can give recommendations t allocate the resources more efficiently and optimize advertising strategies to deliver better outcomes for our clients.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** We collected data on both Facebook and AdWords campaigns, including metrics such as clicks, conversions, and costs.
   Data sourced from Kaggle.com
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Utilizing Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, we cleaned and prepared the data for analysis.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I performed EDA to gain insights into the distributions, trends, and relationships within the data. Seaborn and Matplotlib were instrumental in visualizing the data.
5. **A/B Testing:** We conducted A/B testing to compare the performance of the two platforms. Hypothesis testing techniques were employed to determine statistical significance.
6. **Regression Analysis:** Utilizing Scikit-learn's Linear Regression and Statsmodels, I performed regression analysis to model the relationship between advertising metrics and identify key factors driving performance.
7. **Time Series Analysis:** I applied time series analysis techniques to understand the temporal patterns and seasonality in campaign performance.
